Question 11: How many strings does a guitar have?

Most acoustic guitars have six strings (E-A-D-G-B-E), while electric guitars often have six or seven strings. The number of strings can vary depending on the type of guitar and its intended use.

Question 12: How many legs does a cat have?

Domestic cats typically have four legs, which they use to move around, hunt, and interact with their environment.

Question 13: What is chocolate made from?

Chocolate is made from cacao beans, which are harvested from the pods of Theobroma cacao trees. Cacao beans contain the main ingredients for making chocolate: cocoa solids, sugar, and milk (optional).

Question 14: Name a translation app.

Some popular translation apps include Google Translate, Microsoft Translator, and iTranslate. These apps use machine learning algorithms to recognize spoken or written language and provide real-time translations.

Question 15: Name a red fruit.

Some examples of red fruits include strawberries, cherries, cranberries, and pomegranates. Fresh or dried, these fruits are nutritious and delicious additions to various recipes.

Question 16: Complete: Social media helps ___

Social media helps people connect with each other, share information, and build communities around shared interests or causes. It has become an essential tool for personal and professional communication, marketing, and networking.

Question 17: What gas do plants need?

Plants require carbon dioxide (CO2) to undergo photosynthesis, the process by which they convert sunlight into energy.

Question 18: How many wheels does a bicycle have?

Most bicycles have two wheels, with some exceptions like recumbent bikes or three-wheeled vehicles. The number of wheels depends on the type of bike and its intended use.

Question 19: What is email?

Email (electronic mail) is a system for sending messages electronically over the internet using email clients or web-based services like Gmail, Outlook, or Yahoo! Mail. Emails allow users to send messages with attachments, track responses, and organize communication in a digital format.

Question 20: What is ice made of?

Ice is formed when water freezes, typically at temperatures below 32°F (0°C). This occurs through a process called crystallization, where water molecules bond together to form a crystal lattice structure.

Question 21: What is the internet?

The internet refers to a global network of interconnected computers and servers that communicate using standardized protocols. It allows for rapid information exchange, remote access to services and resources, and e-commerce.

Question 22: What is automation?

Automation refers to the use of technology to perform tasks or processes without human intervention. This can include robotic process automation (RPA), artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and other technologies that streamline operations and increase efficiency.

Question 23: What is fraud detection?

Fraud detection involves using algorithms, machine learning models, and data analysis techniques to identify suspicious transactions or behaviors that may indicate fraudulent activity. This helps prevent financial losses and ensures the integrity of online transactions.

Question 24: How many teeth do adults have?

Adult humans typically have 32 teeth, including incisors, canines, premolars, and molars, although some people may have fewer teeth due to various reasons like tooth loss or congenital conditions.

Question 25: How many cores does a quad-core processor have?

A quad-core processor has four processing cores, which allow for simultaneous execution of multiple tasks and improved overall system performance. This is especially important in applications that require heavy computational loads, such as gaming, video editing, or scientific simulations.

Question 26: What is anomaly detection?

Anomaly detection involves identifying unusual patterns or behavior within a dataset that may indicate an error, anomaly, or potential issue. Techniques like statistical process control (SPC), machine learning algorithms, and data visualization are used to identify these anomalies and take corrective action.

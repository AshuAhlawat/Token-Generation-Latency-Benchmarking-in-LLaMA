I'll provide detailed answers to each question without asking follow-up questions. Here are the answers:

Question 121: What characterizes big data?

Big data refers to extremely large and complex datasets that traditional data processing applications cannot handle adequately. Characterizing big data involves three key dimensions: volume, velocity, and variety.

1. **Volume**: Big data is characterized by massive amounts of data generated from various sources, such as social media, sensors, log files, and more.
2. **Velocity**: The speed at which this data is generated and processed is incredibly fast, often exceeding the capacity of traditional data processing systems.
3. **Variety**: Big data comes in diverse formats, including structured (e.g., relational databases), semi-structured (e.g., XML, JSON), and unstructured data (e.g., images, videos, audio files).

Question 122: What is cloud computing?

Cloud computing delivers computing services, including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics, over the internet. This allows users to access resources on-demand without owning physical infrastructure, providing:

1. **Scalability**: Cloud resources can be easily scaled up or down as needed.
2. **Cost-effectiveness**: Users only pay for the services used, reducing capital expenditures.
3. **Flexibility**: Cloud computing enables access from anywhere, at any time, using various devices.

Question 123: What is the main advantage of edge computing?

The main advantage of edge computing is that it reduces latency and bandwidth usage by processing data near the source rather than in centralized cloud data centers. This proximity improves response times for real-time applications, such as:

1. **Real-time analytics**: Edge computing enables faster analysis and decision-making.
2. **IoT**: Edge computing helps reduce communication costs and improve IoT device performance.
3. **Autonomous systems**: Edge computing is crucial for autonomous vehicles and other latency-sensitive applications.

Question 124: What does '5G' stand for?

The term "5G" represents the fifth generation of mobile network technology. It promises significantly faster speeds, lower latency, and greater connectivity than previous generations, enabling innovations like:

1. **Autonomous vehicles**: 5G supports real-time communication and data exchange.
2. **Smart cities**: 5G enables the integration of various city systems and services.
3. **Remote surgery**: 5G's low latency makes it suitable for remote surgical procedures.

Question 125: What does 'NLP' stand for?

"NLP" stands for Natural Language Processing, a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers understand, interpret, and generate human language in a valuable way. NLP enables applications like:

1. **Chatbots**: NLP powers conversational interfaces.
2. **Language translation**: NLP facilitates machine-aided language translation.
3. **Sentiment analysis**: NLP helps analyze emotions and opinions expressed in text.

Question 126: What is computer vision used for?

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world, enabling machines to:

1. **Identify objects**: Computer vision recognizes and classifies objects.
2. **Recognize faces**: Computer vision detects and verifies human identities.
3. **Read text**: Computer vision extracts text from images or videos.
4. **Navigate environments**: Computer vision helps robots and autonomous systems navigate through spaces.

Question 127: What is deep learning based on?

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns in data, mimicking the way human brains process information. Deep learning is based on:

1. **Artificial neural networks**: Inspired by the structure and function of biological neurons.
2. **Backpropagation**: A technique for training neural networks using error gradients.
3. **Activation functions**: Mathematical operations that introduce non-linearity to neural network computations.

Question 128: What field combines engineering and AI?

Robotics combines engineering, computer science, and artificial intelligence to design, build, and operate robots that can perform tasks autonomously or with human guidance. Robotics has applications in:

1. **Manufacturing**: Industrial robots automate production processes.
2. **Healthcare**: Robots assist surgeons and provide patient care.
3. **Exploration**: Robots explore environments, such as space or underwater.
4. **Service industries**: Robots interact with humans in various settings, like retail or hospitality.

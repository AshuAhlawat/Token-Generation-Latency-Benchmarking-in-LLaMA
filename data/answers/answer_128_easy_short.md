2. What is quantum computing?
Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations and operations on data at an exponentially faster rate than classical computers. It relies on the manipulation of qubits (quantum bits) which can exist in multiple states simultaneously, allowing for parallel processing and potential solutions to complex problems.

3. Name a search engine.
Google is one example of a popular search engine.

4. What is dimensionality reduction?
Dimensionality reduction is a technique used in machine learning and data analysis that aims to reduce the number of features or dimensions in a dataset while preserving as much information as possible. This can help simplify complex data, reduce noise, and improve model performance.

5. Name a music streaming service.
Spotify is one example of a popular music streaming service.

6. Name a ride-sharing service.

9. How many keys are on a standard keyboard?
A standard QWERTY keyboard typically has 104 keys (including the numeric keypad).

10. What is predictive analytics?
Predictive analytics is a type of data analysis that uses statistical models to forecast future outcomes or behaviors based on historical data and patterns. It can be used for applications such as customer segmentation, risk assessment, and supply chain optimization.

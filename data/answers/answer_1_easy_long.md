The field that combines engineering and AI is Robotics. Robotics is a multidisciplinary field that brings together concepts from engineering, computer science, and artificial intelligence to design, build, and operate robots that can perform tasks autonomously or with human guidance.

Robotics involves the application of various engineering disciplines such as mechanical, electrical, and software engineering to develop robotic systems. It also incorporates AI and machine learning techniques to enable robots to perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions accordingly.

In robotics, AI is used to give robots the ability to learn from experience, adapt to new situations, and improve their performance over time. AI algorithms are used in various aspects of robotics, including:

1. Perception: AI helps robots to perceive their environment through computer vision, sensor fusion, and machine learning.
2. Control: AI enables robots to control their movements and actions through motion planning, trajectory generation, and control algorithms.
3. Decision-making: AI allows robots to make decisions based on sensory input, goals, and constraints.

The combination of engineering and AI in robotics has led to the development of various applications across industries such as:

1. Manufacturing: Robotics is used in manufacturing to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and increase product quality through automation.
2. Healthcare: Robots are used in healthcare to assist with surgery, patient care, and rehabilitation.
3. Exploration: Robots are used in exploration to navigate challenging environments, collect data, and perform tasks that require human-like dexterity.
4. Service industries: Robotics is used in service industries such as retail, hospitality, and customer service to improve customer experience and efficiency.

In summary, the field that combines engineering and AI is Robotics, which brings together concepts from multiple disciplines to develop intelligent machines that can perform complex tasks autonomously or with human guidance.

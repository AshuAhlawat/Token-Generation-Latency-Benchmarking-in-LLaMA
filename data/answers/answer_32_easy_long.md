I'll provide detailed answers to the questions without asking return questions. Here are the answers:

**Question 97**
The primary purpose of photosynthesis for plants is to produce glucose (sugar) as an energy source for growth and development, while also producing oxygen as a byproduct.

**Question 98**
The water cycle is driven by the process of evaporation from the surface of oceans, lakes, and rivers, which creates a continuous flow of water vapor into the atmosphere. This vapor then condenses into clouds, leading to precipitation in the form of rain or snow. The cycle is completed when this precipitation returns to the surface as runoff or groundwater.

**Question 99**
Gravity is caused by the interaction between two objects with mass (e.g., Earth and an object on its surface). According to Einstein's theory of general relativity, massive objects warp the fabric of spacetime around them, creating a gravitational field that attracts other objects with mass. The strength of this attraction depends on the mass of the objects involved.

**Question 100**
The human heart has four chambers: the right atrium, left atrium, right ventricle, and left ventricle.

**Question 101**
The fundamental principle of democracy is majority rule, which means that decisions are made based on the collective will of the people, as expressed through elections, referendums, or other forms of direct or representative participation.

**Question 102**
"WWW" stands for World Wide Web, a system of interlinked hypertext documents and servers accessed via the internet.

**Question 103**
The main greenhouse gas contributing to climate change is carbon dioxide (CO2), which accounts for about 65% of human-caused warming. Other important contributors include methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and fluorinated gases (F-gases).

**Question 104**
"AI" stands for Artificial Intelligence, a field that focuses on creating intelligent machines capable of performing tasks typically requiring human intelligence.

**Question 105**
One type of renewable energy is solar power, which harnesses the sun's energy to generate electricity or heat.

**Question 106**
The study of ecosystems is called ecology (from the Greek word "oikos," meaning "household" or "home").

**Question 107**
"DNA" stands for Deoxyribonucleic Acid, a molecule that contains the genetic instructions used in the development and function of all known living organisms.

**Question 108**
The three pillars of sustainability are economic prosperity (meeting human needs), environmental protection (preserving natural resources), and social equity (ensuring fair distribution of benefits).

**Question 109**
The main goal of machine learning is to enable computers to learn from experience, improve their performance over time, and make decisions without being explicitly programmed.

**Question 110**
Our solar system consists of eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Additionally, there are dwarf planets, asteroids, comets, and other celestial bodies.

**Question 111**
One benefit of globalization is increased economic interconnectedness, which can lead to job creation, investment opportunities, and improved standards of living for many people worldwide.

**Question 112**
The primary purpose of cybersecurity is to protect digital systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, attacks, or damage by implementing various security measures and best practices.

**Question 113**
Blockchain is primarily known for its decentralized, distributed ledger technology that enables secure, transparent, and tamper-proof transactions without a central authority.

**Question 114**
What makes quantum computers different is their ability to process certain types of complex problems much faster than classical computers due to the principles of superposition, entanglement, and interference in quantum mechanics.

**Question 115**
Biotechnology is used for various applications, including medicine (e.g., genetic engineering), agriculture (e.g., genetically modified organisms), environmental cleanup, and industrial manufacturing (e.g., biofuels).

**Question 116**
Nanotechnology works at the atomic and molecular scale, typically between 1 and 100 nanometers.

**Question 117**
"VR" stands for Virtual Reality, a technology that creates immersive, interactive digital environments simulating physical presence in real or imagined worlds.

**Question 118**
"AR" stands for Augmented Reality, which overlays digital information and virtual objects onto the real world through devices like smartphones, tablets, or special glasses.

**Question 119**
Another name for 3D printing is Additive Manufacturing (AM).

**Question 120**
"IoT" stands for Internet of Things, a network of physical devices embedded with sensors, software, and connectivity that enables them to collect and exchange data.

**Question 121**
What characterizes big data are its three V's: volume (extremely large datasets), velocity (fast-paced data generation), and variety (complexity and heterogeneity of data sources).

**Question 122**
Cloud computing delivers computing services over the internet, allowing users to access resources on-demand without owning physical infrastructure.

**Question 123**
The main advantage of edge computing is its ability to reduce latency and bandwidth usage by processing data near the source rather than in centralized cloud data centers.

**Question 124**
"5G" stands for Fifth Generation, a wireless network technology that promises faster speeds, lower latency, and greater connectivity for various applications.

**Question 125**
"NLP" stands for Natural Language Processing, a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers understand, interpret, and generate human language in a valuable way.

**Question 126**
Computer vision is used to enable machines to identify objects, recognize faces, read text, and navigate environments through image and video analysis.

**Question 127**
Deep learning is based on the concept of artificial neural networks with multiple layers that can learn and improve from experience, mimicking the way human brains process information.

**Question 128**
The field that combines engineering and AI is robotics, which designs, builds, and operates robots to perform tasks autonomously or with human guidance.

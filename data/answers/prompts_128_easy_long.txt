Here are the answers for each of the 128 questions:

**1.** The primary purpose of photosynthesis for plants is to produce glucose and oxygen.

**2.** Water vapor in the air condenses into clouds, which then produce precipitation that flows back into water bodies through rivers and streams.

**3.** Gravity is caused by the attraction between objects with mass.

**4.** The human heart has four chambers: the left and right atria, and the left and right ventricles.

**5.** Democracy emphasizes principles like majority rule, minority rights, individual freedoms, and equality under the law.

**6.** 'WWW' stands for World Wide Web, a system of interlinked hypertext documents on the internet.

**7.** The main greenhouse gas contributing to climate change is carbon dioxide (CO2).

**8.** 'AI' stands for Artificial Intelligence, a field of computer science focused on creating systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence.

**9.** One type of renewable energy is solar power from the sun's rays.

**10.** Ecosystems are complex networks of living organisms interacting with each other and their physical environment.

**11.** 'DNA' stands for Deoxyribonucleic acid, the hereditary material in humans and most other organisms.

**12.** The three pillars of sustainability are economic prosperity, environmental protection, and social equity.

**13.** The main goal of machine learning is to enable computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

**14.** Our solar system consists of the Sun and eight planets, their moons, asteroids, comets, and other space debris.

**15.** One benefit of globalization is increased economic opportunities and cultural exchange.

**16.** Cybersecurity involves protecting digital systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, attacks, and damage.

**17.** Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that provides transparency, immutability, and decentralization without requiring a central authority.

**18.** Quantum computing uses quantum mechanical phenomena like superposition and entanglement to process information in ways that classical computers cannot.

**19.** Biotechnology combines biological sciences with engineering and technology to develop or create products and processes that benefit human life.

**20.** Nanotechnology works at the atomic and molecular scale, typically between 1 and 100 nanometers.

**21.** 'VR' stands for Virtual Reality, an immersive technology that creates computer-generated three-dimensional environments.

**22.** 'AR' stands for Augmented Reality, which overlays digital information and virtual objects onto the real world.

**23.** Another name for 3D printing is Additive Manufacturing, a process that creates three-dimensional objects by depositing material layer by layer.

**24.** The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the network of physical devices embedded with sensors, software, and connectivity.

**25.** Big data are extremely large and complex datasets that traditional data processing applications cannot handle adequately.

**26.** Cloud computing delivers computing services including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics over the internet.

**27.** Edge computing brings computation and data storage closer to the location where it is needed, reducing latency and bandwidth usage.

**28.** '5G' stands for Fifth Generation mobile network technology, which promises significantly faster speeds, lower latency, and greater connectivity.

**29.** Natural Language Processing (NLP) helps computers understand, interpret, and generate human language in a valuable way.

**30.** Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world.

**31.** Deep learning uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns in data.

**32.** Robotics combines engineering, computer science, and artificial intelligence to design, build, and operate robots that can perform tasks autonomously or with human guidance.
